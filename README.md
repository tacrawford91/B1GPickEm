The objective: Click each team image only once! Each competitor must remember the order of their selection as they try to selcet all

12 teams in a row without repeating (sorry Maryland and Rutgers)! If you select an image twice, you will lose the game and the score will start back at 0. Do not fret, the top score will be maintained as you progress, to keep the competition true!
